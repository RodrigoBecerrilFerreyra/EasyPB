# EasyPB

## Intro
EasyPB is a web application meant to make hosting Private Battles (PBs) in
Splatoon easy. *[Splatoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon)* is a video
game series where up to eight people can play together at a time. In a PB, there
can be up to ten people in a lobby, with two people forced to spectate the
match. The goal of this project is to allow a host to efficiently manage a PB by
automatically calculating the next matches, allowing the host to focus on
playing instead of writing down who has been spectating.

Currently, the main implementation is hosted on https://pb.inkgen.moe.
